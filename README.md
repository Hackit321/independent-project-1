Licensing
An open source license details how others can use your code. Adding a license to your repository is a good practice because it is how you state your intent.

MIT and GPL are the most common licenses. An MIT license means your code is free to use by anyone and you are not liable (Rails and jQuery use an MIT license). GPL also indicates free usage of the code but when used, the resulting work MUST be open source (Linux, Git and Wordpress use GPL).
